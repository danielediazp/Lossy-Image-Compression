# Simple JPEG

## Overview
This project presents a Rust implementation of a lossy image compression algorithm, specifically designed to work with JPEG format. It leverages the efficiency and safety of Rust to provide a high-performance solution for image compression needs.

## Features
- Lossy JPEG compression: Efficiently reduces the file size of images while maintaining a balance between quality and compression.
- PPM Image Support: Currently supports `.ppm` format images, making it suitable for a variety of applications and use cases.
